# HR Dashboard 📊

This repository contains an HR Dashboard developed using Power BI. The dashboard provides insightful visualizations and reports to help manage and analyze HR data effectively.

## Features ✨

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilize various Power BI visuals to represent HR data in an interactive manner.
- **DAX Measures**: Create complex measures using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to perform calculations on your data.
- **Calculated Columns**: Use DAX to add calculated columns to your data model.
- **Power Query**: Transform and clean your data using Power Query before loading it into the data model.

## Getting Started 🚀

To use this dashboard, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 📋

- Power BI Desktop installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).

### Installation 🛠

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rahmakhaledsalama/HR-Dashboard.git
    ```
2. Open the Power BI Desktop application.
3. Load the HR Dashboard Power BI file (.pbix) from the cloned repository.

## Data Preparation 🗂

### Using Power Query

Power Query is used to import, clean, and transform your data before it is loaded into the data model. The following steps outline the basic process:

1. **Import Data**: Bring in data from various sources such as Excel, SQL Server, or other databases.
2. **Transform Data**: Apply transformations like filtering rows, splitting columns, and changing data types.
3. **Load Data**: Load the transformed data into Power BI for further analysis and visualization.

### Writing Measures and Calculated Columns

Measures and calculated columns are created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). Below are examples of how each is used in this dashboard:

**Measures**

Measures are used to perform calculations on your data. They are dynamic and recalculated based on the context of the report.

Example:

```DAX
Total Employees = COUNTROWS(Employees)

**Calculated Columns**

Calculated columns are added to your data model and used for more static calculations.

Example:

```DAX
Full Name = Employees[First Name] & " " & Employees[Last Name]
